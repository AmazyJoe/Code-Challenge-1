//here is an example of a solution for code 1
//Write a program that prompts the user to input student marks. The input should be between 0 and 100. Then output the correct grade as follows: 
//A > 79, B > 60 to 79, C > 59 to 49, D > 40 to 49, E > less 40.


//solution to this challenge is in this code.
let learnerMarks= parseInt(prompt('Key in a value not greater than 100'));
function gaugeLearnerGrade(marks){
    if (marks >100){
        return "Value above maximum threshold!"
    }else if(marks >79){
        return "You scored an A"
    }else if (marks>=60 && marks<=79){
        return "You scored a B"
    }else if (marks <=59 && marks >=49){
        return "You scored a C"
    }else if(marks <=49 && marks >=40){
        return "You scored a D"
    }else if(marks <40){
        return "You scored an E"
    }else{
        return "Key in an integer!"
    }
}
console.log(gaugeLearnerGrade(marks));





//Challenge 2: Speed Detector (Toy Problem)
//Write a program that takes as input the speed of a car e.g 80. If the speed is less than 70, it should print “Ok”. Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points.

//For example, if the speed is 80, it should print: “Points: 2”. If the driver gets more than 12 points, the function should print: “License suspended”.
//solution
//

const speed=parseInt(prompt('captured speed'));
function carFastness(speed){
    if (speed <= 70){
        return "Ok"
    }else if(speed >70){
        let points=(speed - 70)/5

        if (points >=12){
            return "License suspended"
