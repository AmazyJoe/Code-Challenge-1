Challenge 1: Student Grade Generator (Toy Problem)
Write a program that prompts the user to input student marks. The input should be between 0 and 100. Then output the correct grade as follows: 

A > 79, B > 60 to 79, C > 59 to 49, D > 40 to 49, E > less 40.

Here, we are mainly going to focus on Javascript conditionals. The if, if else and else statements that give conditions.
First ,to begin with,let's assume our students are here for a purpose,know their grades. Thus they must be prompted to key in a figure for the answer they want.
That is exactly why we first declare our variable and in this variable,we now declare a function that prompts in the user to pass in an iteger valued from 0 and 100.
That means we also need to take careof those who may pass in a value past 100.For example:
 let learnerMarks= parseInt(prompt('key in a value not greater than 100'));
 After this create another function which now takes in a parameterof the integers,the name you give it is up to you but in our case we will call it MARKS. For the parameter.In our first value, a number greater than 100 is what we will first sort out in case someone gives past 100, then come back to the rubrics because the maximumthreshold given is 100.
